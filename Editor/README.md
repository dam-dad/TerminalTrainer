### Help

Terminal Trainer's Editor main purpose is to create .challenge files with the **name**, **description**, **operative system** and **goals** of a challenge.



On the **left** hand side, we introduce the **black quoted** fields mentioned above.

On the **Goals** table we can press the **+** button to add a default **Goal** that we can edit by clicking on it and writing on the **right** hand side of the application, or press the **-** button to remove a **Goal**.



The **Description** column describes what you have to accomplished with the executed command.

The **Shell** column will be the terminal you will be creating the challenge for. For example: `cmd`, `PowerShell`.

The **PWD** column will determine the path(location) where you execute the commands.

The **User** tells you which user you have to be logged as to do the challenge. For example, if you  have a user with more permissions.



In the <span style='color:turquoise'>blue menu</span>, in the file submenu on top of the app, we can choose to **open** an already existing .challenge file, **save** a .challenge file or create a **blank** new .challenge file to edit.

In the <span style='color:turquoise'>blue menu</span>, in the **edit** submenu on top of the app, we can change the theme of our app.



A folder called `.terminaltrainer` will be created in **your** user folder with the appearance of the app when you closed it.
