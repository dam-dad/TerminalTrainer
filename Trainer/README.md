### Help

Terminal Trainer's Trainer is used to practice your terminal knowledge using .challenge files.



The **challenge** tab shows you the challenge **name**, the **operative system** that the challenge was created for and the **description** of that challenge.

On the **Goals** tab, you are shown the different goals a challenge has with the result that you have to accomplish.



In the <span style='color:turquoise'>blue menu</span>, in the file submenu, we can choose to **Load a challenge** that, like the name says, will load a .challenge file into our app.

In the <span style='color:turquoise'>blue menu</span>, in the **edit** submenu on top of the app, we can change the theme of our app.

### Important

When opening the application, it will ask you for pemission to enable scripts due to our app executing scripts to monitorize your commands executed.
